# UFOs
## 1.	Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to incorporate the data that Dana has gather of UFO sightings of different countries, cities, states, and duration with a brief description of what that person may have witnessed.

## 2.	Results: 
How someone might use the new webpage search criteria is you can filter individually by each of the new categories while leaving the others blank. For example, if you solely want to look up a UFO sighting what was documented on January 13, 2010, all you must do is type the date next to “Enter Date” and the following records will be presented. Another example, if you solely want to look up a shape someone might have witness for instance a circle, the following documentations will appear if you type “circle” next to “Enter Shape”.

## 3.	Summary:. 
One drawback of this new design is having the new search criteria stacked on top of one and other. It takes away of the introduction paragraph, makes the webpage lengthier than what it already is. My two recommendations for further development are one to change the filter search from vertical to horizontal and another is to add more colors or add animation to the webpage because it'll make the website more enaging.
